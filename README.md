# Indian & Overseas Healthcare Data Analysis

Welcome to the Indian & Overseas Healthcare Data Analysis project repository! This project focuses on data analysis using MySQL and Workbench, with an emphasis on data cleanup, SQL insights, and optimization techniques.

## Project Overview

### Data Cleanup Proficiency

In this project, we prioritize data cleanliness and integrity. We employed Python to meticulously prepare pristine datasets for SQL analysis. This meticulous data cleanup process ensures that the data used in stored procedures and triggers is reliable and accurate.

### Actionable SQL Insights

We harnessed the full power of SQL to derive valuable insights from healthcare data. Our SQL queries, stored procedures, and triggers are designed to efficiently manage and manipulate data, providing actionable insights that can inform decision-making in the healthcare domain.

### Efficient Optimization

SQL's optimization techniques play a crucial role in this project. We implemented indexing and other performance-enhancing strategies to improve the efficiency of complex data analysis tasks. This optimization ensures that our SQL queries run smoothly and deliver results in a timely manner.

## Repository Structure

- `/data`: Contains the datasets used in the analysis.
- `/sql`: Includes SQL scripts, stored procedures, and triggers.
- `/docs`: Documentation and guides for setting up the database, running SQL queries, and understanding the data analysis process.
